@node CLEDITOR "Command Line Editor: Giving commands to BBBS"
@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        The command line editor takes care of the line you write your
        commands.  The main purpose of command line is to receive a
        command and execute it.  Most often the prompt looks like this:

        (Conference) Name_of_the_menu (Something_else): _

        The leftmost name in the parenthesis is the current conference.
        The next name is the current menu.  There may also be subprompt
        in parenthesis.  Prompt ends to a colon and after it is your
        cursor.

@{b}USAGE@{ub}
        You enter commands by just by typing the command and pressing
        the <@{i}enter@{ui}> key.  Use the question mark (?) command to see the
        commands currently available to you.

@{b}EDITING@{ub}
        You can edit commands in command line with cursor keys,
        <@{i}backspace@{ui}> and <@{i}del@{ui}>.  The command history can be used with
        <@{i}cursor up@{ui}> and <@{i}cursor down@{ui}> keys, just like in your favourite
        shell.  To erase current command line press <@{i}CTRL-Z@{ui}>.

@{b}REDIRECTION@{ub}
        You can redirect the output of commands on the command line to
        file by using "command >>file".  This will show the ouput of
        the command on the screen and write it to the specified file in
        the user /tmp directory.

@{b}COMMAND CHAINING@{ub}
        There may be several commands and their parameters on one
        command line, separated with spaces.  This is called command 
        chaining or command stacking.

@{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        (Post office) Read Command (? for menu): w

@node EDITOR "Message Editor: Writing messages in BBBS"
@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        You use message editor to write,edit and save your messages.
        There are three different types of editors: @{"line editor" link EDITOR_LINE}, full
        screen editor (@{"FSE" link EDITOR_FSE}) and @{"MG" link EDITOR_MG}.

        Full screen editor can be used to edit message on full screen
        size on the other hand with line editor you can edit message
        with one line at a time. Full screen editor is much easier than
        line editor but it requires your terminal software to support
        ANSI or AVATAR codes. Check your terminal software manual to see
        if one of them is supported.

        If your terminal software does not support ANSI or AVATAR codes
        you must obtain another brand software or use line editor.

@node EDITOR_MG "MG"
You can set this editor to your default editor with command: U ED MG
MG is a GNU Emacs clone and it's the best and the most versatile of BBBS
editors.

Here are a few examples how to define your own start-up commands in MG:

u set "mg_1" "end-of-buffer"
u set "mg_2" "prefix-region"
u set "mg_3" "beginning-of-buffer"
u set "mg_4" "bsmap-mode"

The MG Reference Manual
Release MG2A

Introduction
============

MG is a small, fast, and portable Emacs-style text editor intended to
be used by people who can't run a real Emacs for one reason or another
--- as their main editor on smaller machines with limited memory or
file space, or as a `quick-start' editor on larger systems, useful
for composing short mail messages and the like.

We've made MG compatible with GNU Emacs because that is the `big',
full-featured editor that many of us use regularly and are most
familiar with.  GNU Emacs is the creation of Richard M. Stallman, who
was also the author of the original Emacs editor.  However, MG is not
associated in any way with the GNU project, and the MG authors
individually may or may not agree with the opinions expressed by
Richard Stallman and the GNU project.

MG is largely public domain.  You can use, modify, and redistribute MG
as you like.  A few modules, however, are copyrighted; specifically,
the regular expression code, the VMS termcap routines, and the Amiga
support code.  Look at the source code for the exact copyright
restrictions.

There are several other editors in existence which call themselves
MicroEmacs.  The original public domain version was written by Dave
Conroy and circulated as version 1.6.  Derived from this, there is
another PD version by Dave Conroy numbered v30; a significantly larger
PD version by Daniel Lawrence which is now up to version 3.9; at least
one proprietary implementation; an implementation for the Atari ST
with an integrated command shell, by Prabhaker Mateti; and probably
others that we don't know about.

MG is derived from the v30 MicroEmacs, with key bindings, command
names, and general functionality made more compatible with GNU Emacs.
Like v30, MG is fairly small and quite robust.  We have generally
resisted the temptation to overfeaturize.  Some features which are
large and complex are flagged for conditional compilation.

Many people have contributed their time to developing, improving, and
porting MG.  Mike Meyer, Mic Kaczmarczik, and Bob Larson deserve
particular mention for their efforts.

Questions, suggestions, and offers of help should be addressed to:

        mg-developers\@ucbvax.berkeley.edu   (ARPA)
        ucbvax!mg-developers                (UUCP)

Implementations of MG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MG runs on many different kinds of hardware under many different
operating systems.  Currently, these include:

 - 4.2 and 4.3 BSD Unix (including Ultrix-32)
 - System V Unix
 - VAX/VMS
 - Primos
 - OS9/68k
 - Amiga
 - Atari ST
 - MS-DOS

This document describes release MG2A.  When we talk of different
versions of MG in this manual, the term "version" is used to
refer to the different support MG provides for the various machines
and operating systems it runs under, not to different releases of MG
itself.  For example, we might speak of how the VMS version of MG
differs from the Unix version.

As mentioned above, some MG commands may not be implemented in all
versions; these are noted in the documentation.  Some versions of MG
also support features (such as mouse handling) that are not described
here.

A Note on Character Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MG uses the 128-character ASCII character set, and provides support for
8-bit characters.  Whether the particular version of MG that you are running
knows about extended character sets depends on whether your terminal and
the host operating system know about them.  Moreover, since there is no
standard 8-bit character set, the same character codes will probably
give different glyphs on different systems.  Most versions of MG use
the DEC multinational character set.

Notation and Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this manual, commands and other things that must be typed in
literally are indicated in a typewriter font, like "next-line".
Placeholders such as command argument names use an italic font.

The terms "command" and "function" are synonymous.  We often
speak of a command being bound to a particular "key", although you
may actually have to type more than one character to form a single key.
Most commands are bound to keys with "control" and "meta" modifiers.

To type a control character, use the control key on your
keyboard like a shift key:  hold down the control key while typing the
character.  In this manual, we will indicate control characters like
"C-x" --- here, typing the character `x' while holding down
the control key.

Some keyboards also have a meta key that works like the control
key.  (It may be labelled something else;  on the Atari ST, for example,
the key marked  `Alternate' is the meta key.)  If your keyboard doesn't
have a meta key, don't panic.  You can also use the escape key as a meta
prefix; first type the escape, and "then" the character.  Meta
characters will be indicated as "M-x".

Besides the meta prefix, two other characters are used as prefixes:
"C-x" and "C-h".  A few keys have special notation:  "SPC" is
the space character, "DEL" is the delete or rubout character, "RET"
is carriage return, and "ESC" is the escape character.  "NUL" is
the null character (ASCII 0), which is usually equivalent to either
"C-SPC" or "C-\@".

Uppercase and lowercase characters are generally equivalent in command
keystrokes.

When you run MG from a shell, command line arguments are interpreted as the
names of files you want to "visit", or edit.  Each file is
read into a "buffer" in memory.  No changes are actually made to
the file until you ask it to be written out to disk.

Within MG, the large top part of the screen serves as a "window" into
the buffer being edited.  Below this is the "mode line", which
displays the name of the buffer.  Finally, at the very bottom of the screen,
there is a one-line "minibuffer" which is used for displaying
messages and answering questions.

MG keeps track of two pointers into each window, the "point" and the
"mark".  The "cursor" appears at the point in the current
window, and we often speak of moving the cursor rather than of moving the
point.  The text between the point and the mark is referred to as the
"region".

Some commands deal with "words" and "paragraphs".
Generally, whitespace and punctuation separate words.  Lines that are
empty or that contain only spaces or tabs separate paragraphs without
being part of a paragraph.  A non-empty line that starts with a space
or tab also begins a new paragraph.

A number of commands are defined as "toggles".  If no prefix argument
is supplied, these commands toggle an action.  The action is turned on if a
negative or zero argument is supplied, and turned on if a positive argument
is supplied.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document is intended primarily as a reference manual.  If you
have never used any Emacs-like text editor before, it is strongly
suggested that you run the on-line tutorial supplied with the MG
distribution, instead of reading this manual.

Do not be put off by the large number of commands described in this
manual!  It is possible to get by with only a handful of basic commands.
Here are the ones that are probably used most frequently:

C-p     Move the cursor to the previous line
C-n     Move the cursor to the next line
C-b     Move the cursor backwards
C-f     Move the cursor forwards
C-v     Scroll forwards one screenful
M-v     Scroll backwards one screenful
M-<     Go to the beginning of the buffer
M->     Go to the end of the buffer
C-a     Go to the beginning of the line
C-e     Go to the end of the line
DEL     Delete the previous character
C-k     Kill (delete) to the end of line
C-y     Reinsert killed text.
C-x C-c Exit MG
C-x C-s Save the current buffer

Using Commands
==============

Command Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some commands require arguments.  For example, if you want to read a
file into a buffer, you must type in the name of the file.  In the
descriptions of commands in this manual, if arguments are required,
they are listed following the command name.

MG prompts for command arguments in the minibuffer.  Within the minibuffer,
the following characters can be used for editing:

DEL, C-h        Erase the last character.
C-x, C-u        Erase the entire input line.
C-w             Erase to the beginning of the previous word.
C-q, backslash  Quote the next character typed.
RET             Signifies that you have completed typing in the argument.
C-g             Abort the command in progress.

Prefix Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All commands accept an optional numeric prefix argument.  This is
often interpreted as a repetition count.  For example, the function
"next-line", if given a prefix argument, will move the cursor
forward that many lines; without an argument, it will move the cursor
forward one line.  A few commands behave differently if given a prefix
argument than they do without one, and others ignore the prefix
argument entirely.


digit-argument              M-0, M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4, M-5, M-6, M-7, M-8, M-9
negative-argument                                                        M--

One way to specify a command argument is to use the escape key
as a meta prefix, and then type one or more digits.  A dash may be
used for a negative argument.


universal-argument                                                      C-u

Another way to specify a command prefix is to type "C-u".
Typing one "C-u" is equivalent to a prefix argument of 4, typing
two gives a value of 16, and so on.  In addition, you can type digits
following "C-u" to form a numeric prefix argument.

Aborting
~~~~~~~~

keyboard-quit                                                           C-g

Typing "C-g" cancels any command.  It is particularly useful
for cancelling a command when MG is prompting for input in the minibuffer.

Extended Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

execute-extended-command command                                        M-x

Commands that are not bound to keys can be executed through
"execute extended-command".  If a prefix argument is supplied, it
is passed to the command being executed.


Moving the Cursor
=================

The commands described in this chapter move the cursor (sometimes
called the point or dot) within the current window.  Commands which
set the mark are included here as well.

backward-char                                                           C-b

Moves the cursor backward (left) one character.  If the cursor
is at the left margin, it will be moved to the end of the previous line.

backward-paragraph                                                      M-[

Moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of the current
paragraph, or to the beginning of the previous paragraph if the cursor
is already at the beginning of a paragraph.

backward-word                                                           M-b

Moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of the current word,
or to the beginning of the previous word if the cursor is already at
the beginning of a word.

beginning-of-buffer                                                     M-<

Moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of the buffer.

beginning-of-line                                                       C-a

Moves the cursor backwards to the beginning of the current
line.  This command has no effect if the cursor is already at the beginning
of the line.

end-of-buffer                                                           M->

Moves the cursor forwards to the end of the buffer.

end-of-line                                                             C-e

Moves the cursor forwards to the end of the current line.  This
command has no effect if the cursor is already at the end of the line.

exchange-point-and-mark                                             C-x C-x

Set the mark at the current cursor position, and move the cursor
to the old location of the mark.

forward-char                                                            C-f

Moves the cursor forwards one character.  If the cursor is at the
end of a line, it will be moved to the first character on the next line.

forward-paragraph                                                       M-]

Moves the cursor forwards to the next paragraph delimiter.

forward-word                                                            M-f

Moves the cursor forwards to the end of the current word, or to
the end of the next word if the cursor is already at the end of a word.

goto-line line-number

Moves the cursor to the beginning of line "line-number" in
the buffer.

next-line                                                               C-n

Moves the cursor down one line.  The cursor remains in the same
column unless it would be past the end of the line, in which case it is
moved to the end of the line.  At the end of the buffer, "C-n" will
create new lines.

previous-line                                                           C-p

Moves the cursor up one line.    The cursor remains in the same
column unless it would be past the end of the line, in which case it is
moved to the end of the line.

recenter                                                                C-l

Redraws the entire screen, scrolling the current window if necessary
so that the cursor is near the center.  With a positive prefix argument
"n", the window is scrolled so that the cursor is "n" lines
from the top.  A negative prefix argument puts the cursor that many lines
from the bottom of the window.

redraw-display

Redraws the entire screen, but never scrolls.

scroll-down                                                             M-v

Scrolls the display down (moving backward through the buffer).  Without
an argument, it scrolls slightly less than one windowful.  A prefix argument
scrolls that many lines.

scroll-one-line-down
scroll-one-line-up

These functions are similar to "scroll-down" and "scroll-up"
(respectively), but when invoked without an argument, cause the display
to scroll by one line only.  These functions are enabled by defining the
compile-time option GOSMACS.

scroll-other-window                                                   M-C-v

Scrolls the `other' window forward as for "scroll-up".

scroll-up                                                               C-v

Scrolls the display up (moving forward through the buffer).  Without an
an argument, it scrolls slightly less than one windowful.  A prefix argument
scrolls that many lines.

set-mark-command                                                        NUL

Set the mark at the current cursor position.

what-cursor-position                                                  C-x =

Prints some information in the minibuffer about where the cursor is.


Text Insertion Commands
=======================

The usual way to insert text into a buffer is simply to type the
characters.  The default binding for all of the printing characters
("self-insert-command") causes them to be inserted literally at
the cursor position.

insert  string

Insert "string" into the current buffer at the cursor position.

newline                                                                 RET

Insert a line break into the current buffer at the cursor position,
moving the cursor forward to the beginning of the new line.

newline-and-indent                                                      C-j

Insert a line break into the current buffer at the cursor position,
then add extra whitespace so that the cursor is aligned in the same
column as the first non-whitespace character in the previous line.

open-line                                                               C-o

Inserts a line break into the current buffer at the current position,
but does not move the cursor forward.

quoted-insert                                                           C-q

This command acts as a prefix to
cancel the normal interpretation of the next keystroke.  If "C-q"
is followed by one to three octal digits, it is interpreted as the
code of the character to insert.  Otherwise a single key is read and
the character typed is inserted into the buffer instead of interpreted
as a command.  This is used for inserting literal control characters
into a buffer.

self-insert-command

This is the default binding for keys representing printable
characters.  The character is inserted into the buffer at the cursor
position, and the cursor moved forward.

Killing, Deleting, and Moving Text
==================================

When text is deleted, it is erased completely.  Killing text, on the
other hand, moves it into a temporary storage area called the kill
buffer.  The saved text in the kill buffer is erased when another
block of text is killed.  Until then, however, you can retrieve text
from the kill buffer.  This can be used to move or copy blocks of
text, as well as to restore accidentally killed text.

backward-kill-word                                                    M-DEL

Kill the text backwards from the cursor position to the beginning
of the current word.  Typing "M-DEL" several times in succession
prepends each killed word to the kill buffer.

copy-region-as-kill                                                     M-w

Copies the text in the region into the kill buffer, without removing
it from the current buffer.

delete-backward-char                                                    DEL

Deletes the character to the left of the cursor.

delete-blank-lines                                                  C-x C-o

Deletes all blank lines after the current line, and if the current
line is blank, deletes it and all blank lines preceeding it as well.

delete-char                                                             C-d

Deletes the character underneath the cursor.

delete-horizontal-space                                         M-backslash

Deletes all spaces and tabs on either side of the cursor.

just-one-space                                                        M-SPC

This is like "delete-horizontal-space", except it leaves a single
space at the cursor position.

kill-line                                                               C-k

If no prefix argument is specified, this function kills text up
to the next newline; or if the cursor is at the end of a line, the newline
is killed.  A prefix argument specifies how many lines to kill.  Typing
"C-k" several times in succession appends each line to the kill buffer.

kill-paragraph

This command kills the entire paragraph containing the cursor.
If the cursor is positioned between paragraphs, the next paragraph is killed.

kill-region                                                             C-w

The region (all text between point and mark) is killed.

kill-word                                                               M-d

Text is killed forward from the cursor position to the next
end of word.  If the cursor is at the end of the word, then the next
word is killed.  Typing "M-d" several times appends the killed
text to the kill buffer.

yank                                                                    C-y

Text is copied from the kill buffer into the current buffer at
the cursor position.  The cursor is moved to the end of the inserted
text.

Searching and Replacing
=======================

Searching
~~~~~~~~~

The ordinary search command in MG differs from that in many other editors
in that it is incremental:  it begins searching as soon as you begin
typing the search string, instead of waiting for you to type the entire
string.

All of the search commands described in this section are case-insensitive.


isearch-backward pattern                                                C-r
isearch-forward  pattern                                                C-s

These commands perform an incremental search backward and
forward (respectively) for "pattern".  MG will move the cursor
to the place in the buffer that matches as much of the pattern as you
have typed so far, as each character is entered.

Within the incremental search, the following characters are interpreted
specially:

DEL     Erase the last character in the search string.

ESC     Stop searching; exit from incremental search
        mode, leaving the cursor where the search brought it.

C-g     If a match has been found, exits from
        incremental search but leaves the cursor in its original position.  If
        the search has failed, this will just erase the characters which have
        not been found from the end of the search pattern.  In this case, you
        must type "C-g" again to abort the search.

C-s     Search forward for the next occurrence of the
        same pattern.

C-r     Search backward for the previous occurrence of
        the same pattern.

C-q     `Quotes' the next character typed, forcing it
        to be interpreted as a literal character in the search pattern.

In addition, normal commands such as "C-a" that do not have special
meanings within incremental search cause the search to be terminated, and
then are executed in the ordinary way.

search-again
search-backward pattern                                                 M-r
search-forward  pattern                                                 M-s
These commands perform ordinary, non-incremental searches.
"Search-again" uses the same pattern and direction as the previous
search.

Replacing
~~~~~~~~~

query-replace pattern replacement                                       M-%

The primary replace command in MG is an interactive query replace.
MG searches forward for occurrences of "pattern", and asks you what
to do about each one.  The choices are:


SPC     Replace this match with "replacement",
        and go on to the next.

DEL     Skip to the next match without replacing this one.

.       Replace this match, and then quit.

!       Replace all remaining occurrences without asking again.

ESC     Quit.

By default, "query-replace" adjusts the case of lower-case letters
in the replacement string to match that of the
particular occurrence of the pattern; for example, replacing `Foo'
with `bar' results in `Bar'.  Upper case letters in the replacement
string are always left uppercase.   In addition, supplying a prefix argument
will also tell "query-replace" to leave the case of the replacement
string as-is.

Note that "query-replace" always performs a case-insensitive search.

Regular Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regular expressions provide a means for specifying complex search
patterns, instead of just a literal string.  The commands in this
section are available only if MG is compiled with the REGEX option
defined.

Regular expression syntax uses the following rules.  Most characters
in a regular expression are considered to be "ordinary" characters,
and will match themselves and nothing else.  The exceptions are the
special characters listed below.

.       Matches any single character except a newline.

*       A suffix operator that matches zero or more
        repetitions of the (smallest) preceding regular expression.

+       A suffix operator that matches one or more
        repetitions of the (smallest) preceding regular expression.

?       A suffix operator that matches either zero or one
        occurence of the (smallest) preceding regular expression.

[...]   Matches any one character listed in the character
        set between the square brackets.  See examples below.

^       Matches at the beginning of a line.

$       Matches at the end of a line.

\\       Except for the situations listed below, acts as a
        prefix operator which causes the character following
        to be treated as an ordinary character.

|       An infix binary "or" operator.
        It applies to the two largest surrounding expressions.

(...)   A grouping construct, usually used to specify a larger
        expression for postfix operators such as "*" or to limit
        the scope of operands to "|".

\\digit  Matches the same text matched by the "digit"th "\\(...\\)"
        construct.  These are numbered from 1 to 9 in the order
        that the open-parentheses appear.

\\`      Matches at the beginning of the buffer.

\\'      Matches at the end of the buffer.

\\b      Matches at the beginning or end of a word.

\\B      Matches anyplace "except" at the beginning or end of a word.

\\<      Matches at the beginning of a word.

\\>      Matches at the end of a word.

\\w      Matches any word-constituent character.

\\W      Matches any character which is "not" a word-constituent.


Some examples may help clarify the rules.

foo             Matches the literal string "foo".

;.*             Matches all strings which begin with a semicolon and
                continue to the end of a line.

c[ad]+r         Matches strings of the form "car", "cdr", "caar", "cadr",
                and so on.

[a-z]           Matches any lowercase letter.

[^a-z]          Matches any character "except" lowercase letters.

[0-9+---]       Matches a digit or sign.

(foo|bar)       Matches either the string "foo" or the string "bar".


count-matches     pattern
count-non-matches pattern

These commands count the number of lines which do or do not
(respectively) match the specified pattern.

delete-matching-lines     pattern
delete-non-matching-lines pattern

These commands delete all lines which do or do not (respectively)
match the specified pattern.


query-replace-regexp pattern replacement

This is the regular expression version of "query-replace".

The "replacement" string may be a constant, or it can refer to
all or part of the string matched by the "pattern". "\\&" in
the replacement string expands into the entire text being replaced,
while "\\n" (where n is a number) replaces the
"n"th parenthesized expression in "pattern".

re-search-again
re-search-backward pattern
re-search-forward  pattern

These are the regular expression equivalents of the ordinary
non-incremental search commands.

set-case-fold-search

This command toggles an internal variable that controls whether
the regular expression search and replace commands pay attention to
case.  By default, regular expression searches are case-insensitive.
Ordinary searches are always case-insensitive and are not affected by
the setting of this variable.


Windows
=======

MG initially has only one text window displayed.  However, you can have
as many windows as will fit on the screen.  Each window has its own mode
line and must display at least two lines of text.  (Note that a MG's
`windows' are distinct from the `windows' handled by screen managers
such as the X Window System.)

Multiple windows may be used to display different buffers.  You can also
have the same buffer displayed in more than one window, which is useful
if you want to see one part of a file at the same time as you are editing
another part.

Although many windows can be displayed at once, only one window is active
at any given time.  This is the window where the cursor appears.

Some commands refer to the `other' window.  This is the window directly
below the current window, or the top window if you are in the bottom window.

delete-other-windows                                                  C-x 1

Makes the current window the only window.

delete-window                                                         C-x 0

Deletes the current window, making the `other' window the
current window.  This command doesn't do anything useful if there is only
one window being displayed.

enlarge-window                                                          C-^

Makes the current window larger.  Without a prefix argument, the
window grows one line; otherwise, the prefix argument specifies how many
lines to grow.

other-window                                                          C-x o

Makes the `other' window the current window.

previous-window

This is like "other-window", except that it cycles through
the windows in reverse order.  This command is available only if MG was
compiled with the GOSMACS option defined.

shrink-window

Makes the current window smaller.  Without a prefix argument, the
window loses one line; otherwise, the prefix argument specifies how many
lines go away.

split-window-vertically                                               C-x 2

Split the current window into two windows, both using the same buffer.


Files and Buffers
=================

Most buffers are used to contain a file being edited.  It is
also possible to have buffers that are not associated with any file;
MG uses these for purposes such as displaying help text, for example.
However, since most commands for dealing with files also deal with
buffers, we have grouped all of these commands together into one chapter.

Buffer Manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

insert-buffer buffer-name

Inserts the contents of the named buffer into the current buffer
at the cursor location.  The cursor moves to the end of the inserted
text.

kill-buffer buffer-name                                               C-x k

The named buffer and its contents are deleted.  If the buffer has
been marked as modified, MG will ask you if you really want to delete it.
Note that, contrary to its name, this command "does not" save the
buffer contents in the kill buffer.

If a buffer is being displayed in a window when it is deleted, MG will
find some other buffer to display in the same window.

list-buffers                                                        C-x C-b

This command writes information about the buffers currently in
use to a buffer named "*Buffer List*".  This buffer is then displayed
in the `other' window; if there is only one window, this command will
split the screen into two windows.

not-modified                                                            M-~

This command makes MG think that the current buffer has not been
modified, even if it really has been changed.  This affects the behavior
of the "kill-buffer" and the buffer-saving commands described below.

MG indicates modified buffers with two stars at the left end of the mode
line.

switch-to-buffer buffer-name                                          C-x b

The current window is mapped onto the named buffer.  If there
isn't already a buffer with that name around, MG will create one.

switch-to-buffer-other-window buffer-name                           C-x 4 b

This command works like "switch-to-buffer", except that the
`other' window is used.  If there is only one window, this command
splits the screen into two windows and maps the named buffer onto one
of them.

Reading and Writing Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

find-file file-name                                                   C-x f
find-file-other-window file-name                                  C-x 4 C-f

These commands are analagous to "switch-to-buffer" and
"switch-to-buffer-other-window", respectively.  The difference is that
these commands look for a buffer associated with the named file.  If no
matching buffer is found, MG will create a new buffer with a name
derived from the filename, and attempt to read the file into the buffer.
If the named file cannot be opened, the buffer remains empty.

insert-file file-name                                                  C-x i

This command reads in the contents of the named file into the
current buffer at the cursor position.  The cursor remains in the same
place.

save-buffer                                                         C-x C-s

If the current buffer has been modified, it is saved.  Buffers
that are not associated with files cannot be written out with this
command.

save-buffers-kill-emacs                                             C-x C-c

This command is used to leave MG and return control to the shell
or other program that was used to start MG.  If there are modified buffers,
MG will ask you if you want to save them before exiting.

save-some-buffers                                                     C-x s

MG will ask you if you want to save modified buffers that are
associated with files.

write-file file-name                                                C-x C-w

The current buffer is written out using the file name supplied.
This is useful for saving buffers that are not associated with files, or
for writing out a file with a different name than what was used to read
it in.

Backup Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

MG provides a way to save a copy of the original version of files which
have been modified and then written out again.  The backup copy reflects
the state of the file as it existed the first time it was read into MG.
The name used for the backup file varies, depending on the operating
system.

This feature is disabled if MG is compiled with NO_BACKUP defined.

make-backup-files

This command is a toggle which controls the state of an internal
variable that determines whether MG creates backup files.

Changing the Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The commands in this section are disabled by defining NO_DIR.

cd directory-name

This command changes MG's notion of the `current' directory
or pathname.  This is used to supply defaults for functions that read
or write files.

The syntax for "directory-name" is obviously specific to the
particular operating system MG is running on.

pwd

Display what MG thinks is the current directory.


Modes
=====

Modes are used to locally alter the bindings of keys on a
buffer-by-buffer basis.  MG is normally in fundamental mode, and these
are the bindings that are listed with the command descriptions in
this manual.  Modes define additional keymaps that are searched for
bindings before the fundamental mode bindings are examined; see the
section on key binding below for more details on how this works.

set-default-mode mode-name

Normally, when MG visits a file, it puts the associated buffer
into fundamental mode.  Using the "set-default-mode" command, you
can specify that MG should default to use some other mode on all subsequent
buffers that are created.  This command is a toggle.  With no prefix
argument, if the named mode is not already on the list of
default modes, then it will be added to the list; otherwise, it is removed
from the list.

No Tab Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

In notab mode, tabs are expanded into spaces instead of inserted
literally into the buffer.  Literal tab characters are displayed as
"^I" (much like other control characters).  These commands are
available if MG is compiled with the symbol NOTAB defined.  (This mode
is mainly for use on systems such as PRIMOS that do not treat tab as a
series of spaces.)

no-tab-mode

This command is a toggle to control whether notab mode is in effect.

space-to-tabstop
Insert enough spaces to move the cursor to the next tab stop.  In
notab mode, this function is bound to "C-i".


Overwrite Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, when characters are inserted into the buffer, they are spliced
into the existing text.  In overwrite mode, inserting a character causes
the character already at the cursor position to be replaced.  This is
useful for editing pictures, tables, and the like.

overwrite-mode

This command is a toggle which controls whether overwrite mode is
in effect.

Auto Fill

Fill mode causes newlines to be added automatically at word
breaks when text is added at the end of a line, extending past the
right margin.  Auto fill is useful for editing text and documentation
files.

auto-fill-mode

This command is a toggle which controls whether fill mode is in effect.

insert-with-wrap

This command works like "self-insert", except that it checks
to see if the cursor has passed the right margin.  If so, it fills
the line by inserting a line break between words.  This command is bound to
"SPC" in fill mode.

fill-paragraph                                                          M-q

Fill the paragraph containing the cursor.

set-fill-column                                                       C-x f

Without a prefix argument, this command sets the right margin
at the current cursor column.  If a prefix argument is supplied, it is used
instead as the line width.

Auto Indent
~~~~~~~~~~~

Indent mode binds "RET" to "newline-and-indent", so
that each new line is indented to the same level as the preceeding
line.  This mode is useful for editing code.

auto-indent-mode

This command is a toggle which controls whether auto-indent mode
is in effect.

Blink
~~~~~

Blink mode makes it easier to match parentheses, brackets, and other
paired delimiters.  When the closing delimiter is typed, the cursor
moves momentarily to the matching opening delimiter (if it is on the
screen), or displays the line containing the matching delimiter on the
echo line.  This is useful for editing Lisp or C code, or for
preparing input files for text processors such as LaTeX that use
paired delimiters.

blink-matching-paren

This command is a toggle which controls whether blink mode is
in effect.

blink-matching-paren-hack

This function behaves like "self-insert", except that it
finds the matching delimiter as described above.  In blink mode, this
function is bound to ")", which flashes the matching "(".  This
function also knows about the pairs "{}", "[]", and "<>".
All other characters match with themselves.

Dired Mode
~~~~~~~~~~

`Dired' is an abbreviation for `directory editor', and it provides a way
to browse through the contents of a directory from with MG.  Dired puts
a directory listing into a buffer; you can use normal editing commands to
move around the buffer, and a special group of commands to manipulate
the files.  For example, there are commands to delete and rename files,
and to read a file into an MG buffer.

Since dired mode rebinds many keys, a table may be helpful:

    C-d      dired-flag-file-deleted
    SPC      next-line
    c        dired-copy-file
    d        dired-flag-file-deleted
    e        dired-find-file
    f        dired-find-file
    n        next-line
    o        dired-find-file-other-window
    p        previous-line
    r        dired-renamefile
    u        dired-unflag
    x        dired-do-deletions
    DEL      dired-backup-unflag

The commands in this section are disabled by defining NO_DIRED.

dired directory-name                                                  C-x d

Creates a dired buffer for the given directory name, and displays
it in the current window.  The files
in the directory are listed, usually along with information about the
file such as its size and timestamp.  The exact format of the information
is system-specific.

dired-backup-unflag

This function removes the deletion flag from the file listed on
the previous line of the dired buffer.

dired-copy-file new-name

Copy the file listed on the current line of the dired buffer.

dired-do-deletions

Deletes the files that have been flagged for deletion.

dired-find-file
dired-find-file-other-window

These function works like "find-file" and "find-file-other-window",
except that the filename is taken from the current line in the dired buffer.

dired-flag-file-deleted

Flag the file listed on the current line for deletion.  This is
indicated in the buffer by putting a `D' at the left margin.  No
files are not actually deleted until the function "dired-do-deletions"
is executed.

dired-other-window directory-name

This function works just like "dired", except that it puts the
dired buffer in the `other' window.

dired-rename-file new-name

Renames the file listed on the current line of the dired buffer.
Note that the dired buffer is not updated to reflect the change.

dired-unflag

Remove the deletion flag for the file on the current line.

Miscellaneous
=============

Help
~~~~

Most of the commands in this section write useful information to the
"*help*" buffer, which is then displayed in the `other' window.

These commands can be disabled at compile-time by defining NO_HELP.

apropos topic                                                         C-h a

This command lists all functions whose names contain a string
matching "topic" in the "*help*" buffer.

describe-bindings                                                     C-h b

Information about the key bindings in effect in the current buffer
is listed in the "*help*" buffer.

describe-key-briefly key                                              C-h c

Information about the binding of "key" is printed in the
minibuffer.

help-help option                                                    C-h C-h

This command lists all of the help options available and
prompts for which one to run.  Currently, these include only "a
to run "apropos", "b" to run "describe-bindings", and "c"
to run "describe-key-briefly".


Keyboard Macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A keyboard macro is a saved set of commands from the keyboard that can be
reexecuted later on.  There can only be one keyboard macro defined at
any one time.

The commands in this section are available unless they have been disabled
by defining NO_MACRO.

call-last-kbd-macro                                                   C-x e

Execute the saved keyboard macro.  A prefix argument can be used
to specify a repetition count.

These functions are used to define a keyboard macro.  All keys
entered after "start-kbd-macro" is executed, up to a "end-kbd-macro",
are remembered as they are executed.  You can then reexecute the same
sequence of operations using "call-last-kbd-macro".


Changing Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MG provides a number of functions for changing the case of text.

capitalize-word                                                         M-c
downcase-region                                                     C-x C-l
downcase-word                                                           M-l
upcase-region                                                       C-x C-u
upcase-word                                                             M-u

All of these commands do the obvious.

Odds and Ends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes miscellaneous commands that don't fit into any
particular category.

emacs-version

Prints information about the version of MG you are running in
the minibuffer.

meta-key-mode

If the particular version of MG you are running supports a meta key,
this function can be used to determine whether MG actually pays attention
to it or not.  If no prefix argument is supplied, the internal variable
that controls the use of the meta key is toggled; a positive value enables
the meta key, while a negative value disables it.

prefix-region

set-prefix-string string
"Prefix-region" is used to prefix each line of the region
with a string.  This is useful for indenting quoted text, making block
comments, and the like.  The function "set-prefix-string" can be
used to set the string used as the prefix.

suspend-emacs                                                           C-z

This command temporarily suspends
MG so that you can run other programs, and later resume editing.  The
exact behavior depends on which operating system you are running MG
under.  Typically, MG will either spawn a new shell as a subprocess, or
return you to the parent process.

transpose-chars                                                         C-t

This command transposes the previous two characters.


Customization
=============

MG provides a limited support for customization.  However, unlike `real'
Emacs, there is no extension language for interpretively defining new
functions.

Key Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

MG allows keys to be rebound locally or globally.  To understand the
difference between the two, some discussion on how modes are implemented
is necessary.

An internal data structure called a keymap is used to look up the
function that is bound to a particular key.  The keymap for
fundamental mode contains all of the default bindings which are listed
with the command descriptions in this manual.  Modes define additional
keymaps that are searched for a binding before the fundamental mode
keymap is examined.  Keymaps have the same name as the mode they are
associated with.

MG does not provide commands for defining new modes, but you can alter
the keymaps for existing modes.

define-key keymap-name key command

This command can be used to modify the keymap for the named mode.

global-set-key key command
global-unset-key key

These commands modify the keymap for fundamental mode.  Bindings
established by "global-set-key" will be inherited by all other modes,
as long as they do not establish local rebindings of the same key.

local-set-key key command
local-unset-key key

These commands modify the keymap currently in effect.


Startup Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although MG does not include a general-purpose extension language, it
does provide a way to read and evaluate commands using a somewhat
different syntax than that used for executing extended commands.  This
is typically used in a startup file to modify key bindings.

A startup file consists of one or more expressions.  Each expression must
appear on a separate line in the file; there may not be more than one
expression per line, nor may expressions span across line breaks.
Whitespace (spaces and tabs) separate the tokens in an expression.  For
historical reasons, parentheses are also considered to be whitespace in
this context.  A semicolon acts as a comment character, causing the rest
of the line to be discarded.

An expression consists of a function name, an optional prefix argument
(given as an integer constant), and arguments to be passed to the
function.  If an argument includes literal whitespace or nonprintable
characters (for example, as in a keystroke argument to one of the key
binding functions described in the previous section), it must be
supplied as a string constant enclosed in double quotes.

Within string constants, the following backslash escapes are available
to specify nonprintable characters:


\\t, \\T          Tab
\\n, \\N          Newline
\\r, \\R          Carriarge return
\\e, \\E          Escape (Meta prefix)
\\^              Control Prefix

\\n              Specifies a character by its ASCII code, where
                "n" may consist of from one to three octal
                digits.

\\fn, \\Fn        Specifies the keycode for the "n"th function key.
                "N" may consist of one or two decimal digits.


The following commands which deal with evaluation of expressions are
disabled by defining the compile-time option NO_STARTUP.  See the
implementation notes for your particular version of MG for information
on how it handles startup files.

eval-current-buffer

Evaluate the expressions in the current buffer.

eval-expression expression

Evaluate the expression supplied.

load file-name

Read in the specified file and evaluate its contents.

@node EDITOR_FSE "FullScreen Editor: FSE"
@{b}TOPIC@{ub}
        Writing  and  editing  messages with full screen editor. This is
        the  basic editor, no fancy features but easier for novices than
        @{"MG" link EDITOR_MG}.

@{b}SETTING UP THE FULL SCREEN EDITOR@{ub}
        Check your terminal software if it can translate ANSI, AVATAR or
        VT320  codes.  Use  util  menu  command  @{"U ED FSE" link UTIL_ED} to select full
        screen editor. Select terminal emulation with @{"U TE" link UTIL_TE}.

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        Full  screen  editor  works similar to usual text editor or word
        processing  software. On startup the screen is blank. The editor
        uses  four  topmost  lines  on  the screen to status display and
        editor  warnings.  The  space  below status lines is reserved to
        entering message.

        Status lines look like this:

Gaming #49 (PRIVATE) to Joe Hacker re: Writing messages
Insert     Indent
Ctrl/Z=Save, Ctrl/Q=Abort, Ctrl/U=Help, Ctrl/W=Autoquote, Move with arrow/WSkey
<---+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7->--+--->

        The information about status lines:

        Line 1: Name of conference
                Number of message in conference
                (PRIVATE) if message is private, else nothing
                Name of the receiver
                Subject of message

        Line 2: Insert/Overwrite
                Indent/No indent
                Possible questions

        Line 3: Explanations for most used keyboard commands

@{b}USAGE@{ub}
        With full screen editor you can write text similar to any
        editor. If insert is on text in front of cursor moves left with
        cursor. If overwrite is on text in front of cursor is
        overwritten.

        Keyboard commands:

<enter> (Carriage return)
        If 'Insert' mode is active a new line is created and the cursor
        is moved to the new line. If 'Overwrite' mode is active you will
        only be moved to the beginning of the next line. If 'Indent'
        mode is active the cursor will move to the next line to the
        position where the previous line started.

<home>
        Pressed once it will move the cursor to the beginning of the
        line, twice it will move to the top of the screen and the third
        time it's pressed it will move to the beginning of the message.

<end>
        Does the opposite of <home>. Press <end> once and cursor moves
        to end of line, twice to move cursor to end of screen and three
        times to move cursor to end of message.

<backspace>
        Erase the character to the left of the cursor.

<del>
        Erase the character cursor is on.

<tab>
        Move the cursor eight characters to the left. (It does not
        indent the text already written)

Contrl-commands
        The ^ character in front of letter means you must press ctrl-key
        and simultaneously press the letter.

        ^A    Move one word backwards.
        ^F    Move one word forward.
        ^R    Page up
        ^C    Page down.
        ^D    Move one character to the right.
        ^S    Move one character to the left.
        ^E    Move one line up.
        ^X    Move one line down.
        ^Y    Erase current line. Restore line with ctrl-B.
        ^G    Erase character, same as <del>.
        ^B    Restore deleted line.
        ^L    Rewrite screen.
        ^N    Show coordinates for cursor.
        ^O    Open new line after cursor.
        ^Q    Quit without save. Same as ctrl-K Q.
        ^T    Erase one word to the right of cursor.
        ^V    Toggles 'insert' and 'indent' modes.
        ^W    Quotes the line. Example of usage:
              1. go to the line you want to quote,
              2. press ctrl-W and the line will be preceded by a mark
                 the sysop has chosen as the quote mark. All extra
                 spaces will be removed from the beginning of the line.
        ^Z    Save message and quit. Same as ctrl-K Z.
        ^K C  Erase to the end of the message.
        ^K O  Write message to disk, overwrite to existing file.
        ^K Q  Quit editing without save. Same as ctrl-Q
        ^K R  Read message from disk to editor.
        ^K S  Change the subject of the message.
        ^K W  Write message to disk, append to existing file.
        ^K Z  Quit and save message, send it to recipients. Same as
              ctrl-Z.

@node EDITOR_LINE "Line Editor"
@{b}SETTING UP THE LINE EDITOR@{ub}
        The line editor is a default to new users. If you have some
        reason to switch full screen editor to line editor use Util menu
        command U ED L.

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        If your terminal software cannot communicate with full screen
        editor you are stuck with line editor. Line editor is a little
        complex editor for message writing. It is VERY recommended to
        use terminal software with capabilities for ANSI and/or AVATAR
        codes.

        As the name says the message is edited with one line at a time.
        That means it is quite inconvenient.

@{b}USAGE@{ub}
        You start writing from the first line of the message. When you
        have written the message press <enter> on the empty line. You
        can choose from following commands:

        Command:        Explanation:
        -------------   ----------------------
        @{i}C@{ui}ontinue        writing the message

        you type is sent to your targeted channel (see @{"/Target" link ECHA_TARGET}) precisely
        as if it was sent with the @{"/Say" link ECHA_SAY}-command.

        There are also a few commands that are of use in groupchat:

        /?    -- display some help.
        /Who  -- show who is currently logged in (as in @{"glob/who" link GLOB_W}).
        /TIme -- show your current time status (as in @{"glob/time" link GLOB_TIM})
        /Quit -- Quit the groupchat.

@node CLEDITOR "Command Line Editor: Giving commands to BBBS"
@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        The command line editor takes care of the line you write your
        commands. The main purpose of command line is to receive a
        command and execute it. Most often the prompt looks like this:

        (Conference) Name_of_the_menu (Something_else): _

        The leftmost name in the parenthesis is the current conference.
        The next name is the current menu. There may also be subprompt
        in parenthesis. Prompt ends to a colon and after it is your
        cursor.

@{b}USAGE@{ub}
        You enter commands by just by typing the command and pressing
        the <@{i}enter@{ui}> button. Use question mark (?) command to see the
        commands currently available to you.

@{b}EDITING@{ub}
        You can edit commands in command line with cursor keys,
        <@{i}backspace@{ui}> and <@{i}del@{ui}>. The command history can be used with
        <@{i}cursor up@{ui}> and <@{i}cursor down@{ui}> keys, just like in your favourite
        shell. To erase current command line press <@{i}CTRL-Z@{ui}>.

@{b}COMMAND CHAINING@{ub}
        There may be several commands and their parameters on one
        command line. Just remember to separate commands with spaces. It
        is called command chaining.

@{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        (Post office) Read Command (? for menu): w
        (Post office) Read Command (? for menu): f get foo.bar
        (Post office) Read Command (? for menu): f up foo.bar "Description" N

@node EDITOR "Message Editor: Writing messages in BBBS"
@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        You use message editor to write,edit and save your messages.
        There are three different types of editors: @{"line editor" link EDITOR_LINE}, full
        screen editor (@{"FSE" link EDITOR_FSE}) and @{"MG" link EDITOR_MG}.

        Full screen editor can be used to edit message on full screen
        size on the other hand with line editor you can edit message
        with one line at a time. Full screen editor is much easier than
        line editor but it requires your terminal software to support
        ANSI or AVATAR codes. Check your terminal software manual to see
        if one of them is supported.

        If your terminal software does not support ANSI or AVATAR codes
        you must obtain another brand software or use line editor.

@node EDITOR_FSE "FullScreen Editor: FSE"
@{b}TOPIC@{ub}
        Writing  and  editing  messages with full screen editor. This is
        the  basic editor, no fancy features but easier for novices than
        @{"MG" link EDITOR_MG}.

@{b}SETTING UP THE FULL SCREEN EDITOR@{ub}
        Check your terminal software if it can translate ANSI, AVATAR or
        VT320  codes.  Use  util  menu  command  @{"U ED FSE" link UTIL_ED} to select full
        screen editor. Select terminal emulation with @{"U TE" link UTIL_TE}.

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        Full  screen  editor  works similar to usual text editor or word
        processing  software. On startup the screen is blank. The editor
        uses  four  topmost  lines  on  the screen to status display and
        editor  warnings.  The  space  below status lines is reserved to
        entering message.

        Status lines look like this:

Gaming #49 (PRIVATE) to Joe Hacker re: Writing messages
Insert     Indent
Ctrl/Z=Save, Ctrl/Q=Abort, Ctrl/U=Help, Ctrl/W=Autoquote, Move with arrow/WSkey
<---+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7->--+--->

        The information about status lines:

        Line 1: Name of conference
                Number of message in conference
                (PRIVATE) if message is private, else nothing
                Name of the receiver
                Subject of message

        Line 2: Insert/Overwrite
                Indent/No indent
                Possible questions

        Line 3: Explanations for most used keyboard commands

@{b}USAGE@{ub}
        With full screen editor you can write text similar to any
        editor. If insert is on text in front of cursor moves left with
        cursor. If overwrite is on text in front of cursor is
        overwritten.

        Keyboard commands:

<enter> (Carriage return)
        If 'Insert' mode is active a new line is created and the cursor
        is moved to the new line. If 'Overwrite' mode is active you will
        only be moved to the beginning of the next line. If 'Indent'
        mode is active the cursor will move to the next line to the
        position where the previous line started.

<home>
        Pressed once it will move the cursor to the beginning of the
        line, twice it will move to the top of the screen and the third
        time it's pressed it will move to the beginning of the message.

<end>
        Does the opposite of <home>. Press <end> once and cursor moves
        to end of line, twice to move cursor to end of screen and three
        times to move cursor to end of message.

<backspace>
        Erase the character to the left of the cursor.

<del>
        Erase the character cursor is on.

<tab>
        Move the cursor eight characters to the left. (It does not
        indent the text already written)

Contrl-commands
        The ^ character in front of letter means you must press ctrl-key
        and simultaneously press the letter.

        ^A    Move one word backwards.
        ^F    Move one word forward.
        ^R    Page up
        ^C    Page down.
        ^D    Move one character to the right.
        ^S    Move one character to the left.
        ^E    Move one line up.
        ^X    Move one line down.
        ^Y    Erase current line. Restore line with ctrl-B.
        ^G    Erase character, same as <del>.
        ^B    Restore deleted line.
        ^L    Rewrite screen.
        ^N    Show coordinates for cursor.
        ^O    Open new line after cursor.
        ^P    Aligns the right margin to the position of the cursor. It
              does not wrap lines which are too long.

              Example of usage:

              1. Find the longest line in the message.
              2. Check the length of the line by pressing <end>.
              3. Go to the first line of the message.
              4. Move to the same x-position as the last character on
                 the longest line.
              5. Press ctrl-P.
              6. Repeat steps 1-5 for all the chapters you want to
                 align.
        ^Q    Quit without save. Same as ctrl-K Q.
        ^T    Erase one word to the right of cursor.
        ^V    Toggles 'insert' and 'indent' modes.
        ^W    Quotes the line. Example of usage:
              1. go to the line you want to quote,
              2. press ctrl-W and the line will be preceded by a mark
                 the sysop has chosen as the quote mark. All extra
                 spaces will be removed from the beginning of the line.
        ^Z    Save message and quit. Same as ctrl-K Z.
        ^K C  Erase to the end of the message.
        ^K O  Write message to disk, overwrite to existing file.
        ^K Q  Quit editing without save. Same as ctrl-Q
        ^K R  Read message from disk to editor.
        ^K S  Change the subject of the message.
        ^K W  Write message to disk, append to existing file.
        ^K Z  Quit and save message, send it to recipients. Same as
              ctrl-Z.

@{b}SETTING UP THE LINE EDITOR@{ub}
        The line editor is a default to new users. If you have some
        reason to switch full screen editor to line editor use Util menu
        command U ED L.

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        If your terminal software cannot communicate with full screen
        editor you are stuck with line editor. Line editor is a little
        complex editor for message writing. It is VERY recommended to
        use terminal software with capabilities for ANSI and/or AVATAR
        codes.

        As the name says the message is edited with one line at a time.
        That means it is quite inconvenient.

@{b}USAGE@{ub}
        You start writing from the first line of the message. When you
        have written the message press <enter> on the empty line. You
        can choose from following commands:

        Command:        Explanation:

@{b}GENERAL@{ub}
        In BBBS, there are both @{b}public@{ub} and @{b}private@{ub}
        nodemessages. Public nodemessages are sent to everybody and
        privates ones only to the person or persons it is private
        to. Each user is given a nickname (stored in the
        @{"NICK environment variable" link UTIL_SET_NICK}). When you receive a public message,
        it is first prefixed by the sending users' nickname in
        brackets. Private messages are prefixed by the users' nickname
        in between asterisks. For example:

        <JoeH> This is a public message you received from 'JoeH'.
        *JoeH* This is a private message you received from 'JoeH'.

        To send a public message, use the command @{"/Say" link ECHA_SAY}. To send a
        private message, use the command @{"/MSg" link ECHA_MSG}.

        To see the nicknames of the people who are logged in, use the
        @{"Who" link GLOB_W}-command.

@{b}CHANNELS@{ub}
        In most BBBS there are also multiple chat channels. You
        receive only those public messages that are sent to the
        channel or channels you are a member of. To see a list of all
        available channels, use the @{"/REPort" link ECHA_REPORT} command. To join to a new
        channel or resign from one use the commands @{"/Join" link ECHA_JOIN} and @{"/Resign" link ECHA_RESIGN}
        respectively.

        The public messages you send are by default sent only to the

@{b}FEELINGS@{ub}
        In BBBS, you can also use various @{"feelings" link ECHA_FEELINGS} (which in fact
        are more like actions) to specify what you do or just inform
        people about something. To see a list of them (a lot!) use the
        command @{"/List" link ECHA_LIST}.

@{b}NOTE@{ub}
        If you just want to chat with other people in the system, you
        might want to use the @{"groupchat" link CHAT_G} instead of the BBBS command
        line.

@node ECHA_FEELINGS "Using chat feelings"
@{b}COMMAND@{ub}
        @{i}*feeling@{ui} [focus] [*"grade"] [<"extension"] [@color]

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        The BBBS chat features feelings, much like the @{i}Internet Relay
        Chat@{ui} or many @{i}Multi-User Dungeon@{ui} games. In BBBS, a feeling is
        more like an action: it describes to other users what you do,
        either in Real Life or just in the BBBS. Feelings are always
        public and posted to everyone, except those who have you in
        their @{"ignore-list" link UTIL_SET_IGNORE}. When feelings are displayed, they are
        prefixed with a single asterisk:

        @{b}* JoeH smiles.
        @{b}* JoeH gracefully bows before his audience.
        @{b}* JoeH mutters an arcane formula and vanishes in a puff of@{ub}
          @{b}logic!@{ub}

        To emit a feeling, simply prefix it with an asterisk. For
        example, the command @{b}*smile@{ub} will make you smile. To see a list
        of all feelings, use the command @{"/List" link ECHA_LIST}.

        Some feelings can have a @{i}focus@{ui}. Other feelings REQUIRE a
        focus. A focus is any other active nickname, i.e. the person you
        want to direct your feeling to. For example, to smile to JoeH,
        just give the command @{b}*smile JoeH@{ub}. The node number of the
        focus can also be used instead of the nick. Which feelings can
        have a focus and which ones require one varies from feeling to
        feeling. For some feelings it is self-explainatory, for others
        it isn't. Try them out!

        All feelings can have a @{i}grade@{ui} and an @{i}extension@{ui} These are
        optional, but can be used to give some "flavor" to the
        feeling. A grade is the grade of the feeling, for example
        "happily", "sadly", "devlishly" etc. Some grades have predefined
        shorthands (for example HAP for happily) to make typing them
        faster and easier, but it can be anything you can think of. To
        add a grade into your feeling, prefix the grade with an asterisk
        and place it after the feeling.

        The extension of the feeling is, well, the extension that should
        be added to the feeling. Where the extension is placed exactly
        varies from feeling to feeling. Again, try them out to see
        how. The extension can be of any length, but if it contains
        spaces it should be placed in double-quotes.

        Some feelings have predefined grades and extensions. Others
        haven't. Yet again, experiment and try out various combinations
        to find them out.

        All feelings are displayed with a distinctive color determined
        by the @{i}class@{ui} the feeling belongs in. Use the command @{b}/List@{ub} to
        see what feelings belong into a spesific class. You can override
        the color of the feeling by adding the string @{b}@color@{ub} to your
        feeling command. "color" can be any of the following: red,
        green, blue, purple, cyan, white.

        If there isn't a built-in feeling that you'd like, you can use
        the @{"/ME" link ECHA_ME}-command to send any text as a feeling.

@{b}EXAMPLES@{ub}
        Let's assume your nickname is "Nick".

        @{b}Command@{ub} *teleport
        @{b}Outputs@{ub} * Nick mutters an arcane formula and vanishes in a puff

        You can enter a comment message to sysop with COM-command. The
        message is stored in conference which is set up as conference

        automatically and the only concern for you to do is write the
        message.

@{b}COMMAND@{ub}
        @{i}e@{ui}nter [-f [filename]]

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        E-command let's you write a message in current conference (see
        command prompt for current conference). The message can be a
        private or public one. It is not allowed to write private
        messages in all areas (you may ask that from your SysOp).

        Exceptions: You cannot write public messages in private
        conference. Sysop can define any area to be read-only. That
        means regular users are not allowed to write any messages in
        them. Often some kind of news conference is set up like that.

        Entering a new message starts a new message chain. Before you
        can write the message you are asked for the receiver of the
        message and the subject of the message. See editor help for
        changing subject inside the editor.

        The receiver of the message can be anybody in BBS userbase or
        ALL. If the receiver is ALL the message must be in public area.
        You don't have to write ALL, just press <enter>.

        A message should have a subject which describes the contents in
        some way. If your message is about food, you might write
        "Hamburgers as the source of nutrition".

        The exception to the above is netmail messages.  Then the
        receiver can be anyone, but the subject line must contain the
        node number of the receiver as the first part.  Sysops can also
        add modifiers before the node number to change the "flavour" of 
        mail.

        @{i}Modifiers@{ui}
          @{b}!@{ub}  Crash
          @{b}-@{ub}  Hold
          @{b}?@{ub}  Receipt Request

          @{b}*@{ub}  Immediate
          @{b}/@{ub}  Kill/Sent

        The sysop can also attach files to local and email messages by
        using "-f [filename] after the command.  When the receipient
        user reads the message, they will be asked if they want to 
        download the message (local) or the file will uucoded and
        attached (email).

        compress them in an archive and send them to you. The compression
        will be done if you have chosen an archive format with the @{"U AF" link UTIL_AF}
        command, otherwise you will get an unpacked ASCII-file. The
        default protocol to use in file transfers may be set with @{"U T" link UTIL_T}
        command. When you have received the message packet all messages
        are set as read. The file that you get with MD is possible to
        edit with just about any editor and also offline readers like
        BMLR, HipHop, NMail, SLMR etc.

        The message packet is created with the character set defined
        with @{"U S" link UTIL_S} command (the default is IBM character set).

@{b}SWITCHES@{ub}

                You have got yourself this far! Excellent!
                             Welcome to system.

        To start with, a few commands and things good to know:

        Try not to be on-line too long, if you are, then the other users
        wont be able to log in, it's also quite expensive to keep the
        phone line open too long. That's if the phone company charges
        you by the minute.

        Menu system in BBBS (quite a clear one):
        @{i}q@{ui} Main menu
        @{i}u@{ui} Util menu
        @{i}f@{ui} File menu
        @{i}r@{ui} Read menu (messages)

        In menus there are commands and also submenus.

        You might have noticed that there are many different conferences
        here. You have been invited to some and are allowed to freely
        join all public areas to which you have read and write rights,
        use the @{"j" link GLOB_J} command. The first lets you one join to a specific
        area while the second prompts you for each area individually
        until all areas have been chosen or not.

        The messages are shown automatically, just keep pressing
        <@{i}enter@{ui}>. Typing @{"re" link READ_RE} lets you write a reply to a message.

        It would be wise to download all the messages to examine them at
        home, off-line. This is done with the @{"md" link GLOB_MD} command but remember
        to first set all the settings in the 'Utility Menu' properly.
        @{"u t" link UTIL_T} will choose the tranfer protocol. You should also choose
        the archiving method to shrink the size of the message packet
        and lessen the transfer time @{"u af" link UTIL_AF}.

        After a while it is good to start using an off-line reader.
        Using an off-line reader will give you the possibility to read
        the messages, after downloading them, at home. You'll also be
        able to reply to them almost as if you were on-line using the
        BBBS. Such programs for the PC are: MR/2, HipHop, BMLR, NMail,
        ASO, POST, BlueWave, OLX, PowerQWK etc. Many of those can be
        found in the file areas of the BBS, if it can't, then tell the
        SysOp to get a hold of one of them. Offline format can be
        selected with @{"u gf" link UTIL_GF} command.

        You have probably noticed that it's possible to chain the
        commands on one line to speed up the usage of the BBS. For
        details on using command line editor see this {"link" link CLEDITOR}.

        When you've read some messages (on-line by just pressing enter)
        and found something you want to comment or answer to, you can do
        that by typing @{"re" link READ_RE} (reply). You will be prompted some questions
        and if you chose to include the old message it will be displayed
        on screen. Now, if you're using the FullScreen Editor, you can
        comment the message with quotes of the author to the message. It
        is customary to type a particular sign in front of all quoted
        lines, this can be done automatically by pressing CTRL-W. The
        sign is most often the '>'. To do it automatically you have to
        move the cursor to the line to quote. Quote only parts of
        message, destroy rest with CTRL-Y command.

        See editor help with CTRL-U command.

        In the BBS there is almost always a conference where the messages
        from the SysOp to the users can be found. Such areas may be
        called News or SysOp News or whatever the SysOp has chosen to
        call the conference. The area is one from which you can't resign
        ie. you have to read the messages, and why not, it might contain
        some important information.

        I hope you make it now. If you're having trouble you can leave a
        message to the SysOp using the @{"com" link GLOB_COM}ment command. He is an
        experienced user and is probably able to answer your questions.

        Note for female users:
        When referring to a him in the help... it can also be a she. :)

        The bulletins are more or less important things that the sysop
        has chosen to include in the bulletin menu. To get a list of all
        available bulletins in the BBS you just type B followed by an
        <enter>. To list the bulletins again you type L at the bulletin
        prompt. W gives you the welcome screen of the BBS.
        Using D after listing a bulletin will immediately start a download
        of the bulletinfile you just read.  To copy a bulletin to your
        /tmp directory as bull?, use A after you have read the
        bulletin.

@{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        b 2    Shows bulletin number 2
        b 2 d  As above, but will also start download of the bulletinfile
               right after you have read it.
        b 2 a  As above, but saves the bulletin as /tmp/bull2.
        b l    Shows a list of available bulletins.
        b w    Shows the welcome bulletin.

        W-command will give you a list of who is logged on to the system
        and it also displays the status of other nodes, if any, on the
        BBS system. On some systems the SysOp has chosen not to show
        empty nodes, this might be because there are so many nodes that
        it would take too long to list all the empty nodes. If someone
        is downloading, BBBS will show estimated transfer end time.

        N gets you back to command line.

        A which gives you the possibility to do a relogin, if for
        example a friend wants to login after you from you computer.

        It is not recommended to hang up without logging out. Your sysop

@node MAIN_HUNT "Play a game of Hunt"
@{b}COMMAND@{ub}
        [q] @{i}hunt@{ui} [-m] <hunt-server>

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        The  object  of  the game @{i}Hunt@{ui} is to kill off the other players.
        There  are no rooms, no treasures, and no monsters. Instead, you
        wander  around a maze, find grenades, trip mines, and shoot down
        walls and players. The more players you kill before you die, the
        better your score is.

@{b}USAGE@{ub}
        You  will  have  to  know  an address for a Hunt server. If your
        SysOp  has installed one, @{b}localhost@{ub} might be a good idea to try.
        If  the @{i}-m@{ui} switch is given, you enter the game as a monitor (you
        can see the action but you cannot play).

        The symbols on the screen are:

        @{i}-|+@{ui}   walls
        @{i}/\\@{ui}    diagonal (deflecting) walls
        @{i}#@{ui}     doors (dispersion walls)

        @{i}g@{ui}     large mine
        @{i}:@{ui}     bullet
        @{i}o@{ui}     grenade
        @{i}O@{ui}     satchel charge

        @{i}\\|/@{ui}
        @{i}-*-@{ui}   grenade and large mine explosion
        @{i}/|\\@{ui}

        You  start  the game by flying to the maze. While you're flying,
        other  players  can see you, even without scanning. In the start
        of  the  game  you  are  cloaked  for  some  time. Cloaking just
        prevents  other players to see you with their scanners, they can
        see you face to face anyway. Scan and cloak can not be on at the
        same  time.  Shooting  can  only be done to the direction you're
        facing to.

@{b}NOTE@{ub}
        When  you  die, other people still keep playing. As you join the
        game again, it goes on in the same maze and the score is changed
        for your killer's favor and your loss. So there's no use to wait
        for other players to leave the game instantly after you died!

@{b}WARNING@{ub}
	Hunt may be dangerous to your health. "Arthritic pain" and "lack
        of  circulation"  in fingers have been reported by hunt abusers.
        Hunt  may also be addictive, and the withdrawal symptoms are not
        pretty.

@node FILE "File Menu Commands"
@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        In  the file menu you can use all of the global commands and the
        file commands. These commands are for transferring files between
        your terminal and the BBS.

        The  file  system  in  BBBS  is  very  much  based  on  the same
        operations  as in normal OS prompt. This means that you can move
        around in the directories with "cd directory" etc.

        Commands  marked  with  letter H have an alias named H + command
        (hget, hcd, etc) which works just like the original command, but
        the job is done to/from @{i}/tmp@{ui} -directory. They are not documented
        separately.  For  example  @{b}get foo@{ub} downloads file named foo from
        the current direcotory, @{b}hget foo@{ub} downloads /tmp/foo.

@node UTIL_TE "Terminal type"
@{b}COMMAND@{ub}

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
        Available terminal emulations are TTY, DumpANSI, ANSI X3.64,
        VT320, and RIP. TTY is very dull, no colors etc. The others can
        display colors, remember to enable @{"col" link UTIL_COL}ors, otherwise you
        will only see grey and white.

        DummyANSI is very slow and is only for improperly working
        terminals with no real ANSI X3.64 scrolling.

        RIP (also known as Rip Script) is a VGA graphics emulation that 
        will allow users to interact with the BBS using VGA menus and 
        their mouse.  The remote user must select RIP and be using a RIP-
        capable terminal program.

        defined pattern. The pattern must match whole filename.

        Wildcard        What it does
        ================================================================
        foz             text "foz" as it is
        *               zero or more characters (any)
        ?               any character
        [foz]           character `f', `o' or `z'
        [!foz]          any other character than `f', `o' or `z'
        [f-j]           equal to command "[fghij]"
        [!f-j]          equal to commnad "[!fghij]"
        \\x              character `x', used finding f.ex. `['

@{b}NOTE@{ub}
        Following  wildcards are valid, but the result might not be what
        you think you asked for.

        Wildcard        What it does
        ================================================================
        *.*             matches filenames with "." in it, not all files
        foo*.*          matches  filenames  starting with foo and having
                        "." in it

@{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
        Wildcard        What it does
        ================================================================
        *               all files
        *foo*           filenames with "foo" in it
        foo*bar[1-4x]   filenames  starting  with  "foo" and ending with
                        "bar" followed by a number from 1 to 4 or "x"
